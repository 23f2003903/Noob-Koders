st.markdown("""
This application uses a model with two main components:
1. **ResNet50** - A deep convolutional neural network that extracts visual features from the medical images
2. **LSTM Network** - A sequence model that generates descriptive captions based on the extracted features

The model was trained on a dataset of medical images with expert-written captions, enabling it to learn the relationship between visual features and medical descriptions.
